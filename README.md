# TokyoAnalyzeUsingAzure
Created simple mini project of Azure using its services.We have uploaded Our demo video Link on Google Drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LiRQW23ER5gb2zd4HnNld_2uvQ2MWKKd?usp=sharing 
Short Description About Project
Project Topic :  Olympic Data Analysis Project
Project report outlines the process of analyzing Tokyo Olympic data using various Azure services. The team, consisting of Ms. Mansi Jadhav, Mr. Jayesh Waingankar, and Mr. Yogesh Pawar, leveraged services like Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, and App Registration. The report includes detailed steps, challenges faced, and lessons learned throughout the project. This project is an Olympic data analysis and reporting solution built using Azure services. In this project 4 azure services are used that are Azure Storage Account, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the analysis of Olympic data using a set of Azure services to perform ETL, data processing, and reporting. The project showcases the following key components:
1)Azure Storage Account: Used for data storage and retrieval.
2)Azure Data Factory: Orchestrates and schedules data workflows.
3)Azure Databricks: Performs data transformations and analysis.
4)Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace: Stores and manages data, and provides a platform for advanced analytics.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
> An Azure subscription.
> Appropriate permissions to create and manage Azure resources.
> Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics provisioned and configured.
> Python and the necessary libraries installed locally for Databricks development.
>PowerBI Desktop to visualise the data which we have processed
>Dataset for analysis
In this Project we have Dataset and we have done analyzation and visualization of the data. Dataset is provided in the github.
